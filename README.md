# Geometric Cube 3D Project in C++

This is my first project in C++. It involves creating a 3D cube using SDL2. The goal of this project is to practice matrix and vector manipulation for rendering 3D objects.

## Features

- Renders a 3D cube.
- Rotates the cube around the X, Y, and Z axes.
- Manipulates 4x4 matrices for projection and transformations.

## Requirements

- C++11 or higher.
- SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

## How to Compile and Run

1. Make sure SDL2 is installed on your machine.
2. Compile the code with the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ -o a main.cpp -std=c++11 -lSDL2
